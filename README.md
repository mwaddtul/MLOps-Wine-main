**What is CML?** Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is an open-source CLI tool
for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) with a focus on
MLOps. Use it to automate development workflows — including machine
provisioning, model training and evaluation, comparing ML experiments across
project history, and monitoring changing datasets.

CML can help train and evaluate models — and then generate a visual report with
results and metrics — automatically on every pull request.
